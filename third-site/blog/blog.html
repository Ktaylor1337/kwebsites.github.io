            <h2><a href="posts/post-2.html">Django Girls</a></h2>
         <p>June 7th 2017</p>

         <p>On Friday I found out that I had got a place on a Django Girls workshop being held in a week's time at a local venue. The workshop takes place over Friday evening and all of Saturday, and the aim is to go away having made a website. 
         <br><br>
        I have already made a couple of websites (including this one you are on right now!) but I am excited and eager to learn more. I will report back once the workshop is over.
        <br><br>
        I have also recently started to use Free Code Camp, a wonderful not-for-profit web application that teaches people how to code for free. So far I am finding it incredibly helpful in helping to consolidate the skills that I do have whilst also teaching me lots of things that I didn't know. I'm especially looking forward to getting stuck in to the developing of projects using Jquery and Javascript.

            <h2><a href="posts/post-1.html">Hello, world!</a></h2>
             <p>May 29th 2017</p>

<p>I bought a course off Udemy for £15 last Christmas and wrote my first line of code on the same day. I followed the course - making a basic website with Bootstrap, HTML5 and CSS3. I was pleased with what I had created (I deviated quite quickly from their theme, eager to get creative). The code is messy and unorganised; it violates best practice - but it's something. I had built something. My first static website. 
<br>
<br>
Next I thought I would have a go at designing an ‘actual’ website with a purpose - so I took my local GP’s website which you can see <a href="http://www.sheffieldmedicalcentre.co.uk/" target="_blank">here</a> ( disclaimer: it’s a UX/UI nightmare), and had a go at re-presenting the information in a new design. <a href ="https://ktaylor1337.github.io/kwebsites.github.io/" target="_blank">This website</a> is almost finished - I just need to get the Google Maps API key working (this has been a source of frustration - I've followed answers given on StackOverflow and <em>nothing works</em>). 
<br>
<br>
My most recent website is a revision/upgrade to my first website - the one you are on now, - this time built using best practice principles (and without a framework), and some other web design tips and tricks I have picked up over the last few months. 
<br><br>
I am quickly becoming hooked on web design and development - I enjoy the challenge of solving problems and the capacity for creativty, but the more I learn (or try to learn, at least), the more acutely I become aware of just how huge this world is. I'm barely getting started.
